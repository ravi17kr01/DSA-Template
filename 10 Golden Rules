♦️ If we are dealing with top/maximum/minimum/closest ‘K' elements among 'N' elements, we will be using a Heap.

♦️ If the given input is a sorted array or a list, we will either be using Binray Search or the Two Pointers.

♦️ If we need to try all combinations (or permutations) of the input, we can either use Backtracking or Breadth First Search.

♦️ Most of the questions related to Trees or Graphs can be solved either through Breadth First Search or Depth First Search.

♦️ Every recursive solution can be converted to an iterative solution using a Stack.

♦️ For a problem involving arrays, if there exists a solution in O(n^2)time and O(1) space, there must exist two other solutions: 1) Using a HashMap or a Set for O(n) time and O(n) space, 2) Using sorting for O(n log n) time and O(1) space.

♦️ If a problem is asking for optimization (e.g., maximization or minimization), we will be using Dynamic Programming.

♦️ If we need to find some common substring among a set of strings, we will be using a HashMap or a Trie.

♦️ If we need to search/manipulate a bunch of strings, Trie will be the best data structure.


♦️ If the problem is related to a LinkedList and we can't use extra space, then use the Fast & Slow Pointer approach.
