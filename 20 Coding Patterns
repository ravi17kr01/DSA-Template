How much time do I need to spend preparing for coding interviews? I've been asked often.

While it will differ for everyone, you should be able to brush up within 8-12 weeks on average.

After that, you should try mock interviews or even try a full loop.

You will fail some, learn from your mistakes.

Another piece of advice I often give:

𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗟𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲; 𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱

Since no one likes spending too much time preparing for coding interviews, follow a smarter path.

Focus on coding patterns instead!

This will save you time and effort.

Follow the below-mentioned 𝟮𝟬 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀 to learn the underline algorithms.

The idea behind these patterns is that once you are familiar with a pattern, you will be able to solve dozens of coding questions with it.

Here are the patterns:

1. Sliding Window
2. Islands (Matrix Traversal)
3. Two Pointers
4. Fast & Slow Pointers
5. Merge Intervals
6. Cyclic Sort
7. In-place Reversal of a LinkedList
8. Tree Breadth-First Search
9. Tree Depth First Search
10. Two Heaps
11. Subsets
12. Modified Binary Search
13. Bitwise XOR
14. Top ‘K’ Elements
15. K-way Merge
16. Topological Sort
17. 0/1 Knapsack
18. Fibonacci Numbers
19. Palindromic Subsequence
20. Longest Common Substring
