Dynamic Programming is hard to master compared to other algorithms.

Most of us learn by looking for patterns among different problems.

But with DP, it can be really hard to actually find the similarities.

𝘈𝘭𝘸𝘢𝘺𝘴 𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳, 𝘋𝘺𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘤 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘣𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 𝘱𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘦.

The key is to find the recurring subproblem and this requires practice.

The more you practice, the more easier will be spotting subproblems.

I found some amazing resources of DP on LeetCode.

I’m sharing with you all, hoping that it will give it a boost in your Interview Preparation whoever is struggling in these topics.
