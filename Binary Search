Frequently asked Binary Search Problems in #MAANG companies

Must Save and Share!!

During my preparation days, there were a lot of topics to be covered and one of them was 'Binary Search'.

BS initially seemed to be a simple and straightforward topic. But over time, as I started solving more questions with medium difficulty, I realized, there's a lot more to this topic than I expected. 🤷🏻‍♀️

So I wondered, are there any good guides to learn binary search in the best way possible in a short span of time?

Did some research and found some reallyyy good Leetcode study guides that can help in a great way to prepare binary search:

📍 A guide to the Binary Search Algorithm: https://bit.ly/3Jigldd
📍 Binary Search for Beginners: https://bit.ly/3jifG0s
📍 Powerful Ultimate Binary Search Template: https://bit.ly/3v2MwYO
📍 Binary-search Interview Questions: https://bit.ly/3KkT8YT
📍 5 variations of Binary search: https://bit.ly/3Jdu1pD

Go through these guides, practice questions, make notes, revise them thoroughly, and ace your interviews. 🔥
